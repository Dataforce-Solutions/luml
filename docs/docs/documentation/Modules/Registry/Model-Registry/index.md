# Model Registry

Selecting a specific object in the Registry opens the Model Registry interface.
This is the control panel for a specific artifact (model), providing access to detailed information and analysis tools.

# Overview
The Overview tab acts as the technical passport of the object. It contains a structured dictionary 
of static metadata describing the file's origin and characteristics. 

This includes:

**General Information** - creation date, author, file size.

**Manifest** - a technical description of the .dfs container's contents.

**Tags and Attributes** - service information for identifying the model within the system.

The other parts of interface are shown as other functional tabs:
- [Model Card](model_cards.md)
- [Experiment Snapshots](experiment_snapshots.md)
- [Attachments](attachments.md)
