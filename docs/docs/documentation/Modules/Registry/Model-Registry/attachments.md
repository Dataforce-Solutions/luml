# Attachments

The Attachments section provides direct access to the internal file system of the .dfs container. 
Designed as a self-contained archive, this format allows for the storage of not only the algorithm's weights but also any supplementary 
materials that provide context for the model's operation.

The system imposes no restrictions on the type or extension of attached files. 
These can range from tokenization vocabularies and training plots to configuration files, audio samples, 
or even project documentation.

For seamless interaction, a File Viewer is integrated into the Registry interface. 
It enables the immediate preview of the most common formats without the need for downloading:
- *Media Content* 

Images (.jpeg, .png, .svg), audio recordings (.mp3), and video files (.mp4).

- *Data & Structures*

Tables (.csv), configurations, and scripts (.json, .xml, .txt).

- *Documents*

PDF reports (.pdf) and web pages (.html).

Files of any other specific formats (e.g., binary data or proprietary extensions) or files over 15MB remain securely 
stored within the archive and are always available for download to a local device.
