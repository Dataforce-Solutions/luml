# Model Card

The Model Card is a specialized dashboard that transforms raw statistical data into 
a clear visual narrative about your model's quality. 
Unlike the technical Overview, the focus here is specifically on interpreting training results.

The first layer of analysis is *Metrics and Visualization*. 
Depending on the task type, the system automatically calculates key success indicators such as Accuracy, F1-score, or RMSE. 
These figures are complemented by charts (such as Confusion Matrices or error distribution curves), allowing you to instantly assess the overall picture and identify where the model errs most frequently.

For a deeper understanding of decision-making logic, the *Feature Importance tool* is available. 
It ranks input parameters based on their impact on the outcome. 
This helps reveal the model's "train of thought": which data points it considers critical for prediction, and which it ignores as noise.
